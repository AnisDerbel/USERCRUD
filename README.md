### Understanding the Test

 - As I understnad from this  ** We would like to run your solution simply by running â€“ "npm run start" ** is the Nodejs project doesn't need to use any extra Database and any other dependencies and framework so I have used  a json file as Database and use pure Nodejs.<br>
 - From the JSON structure that you provide the attribute 'address' is an array so the user can have multiple addresses.

### Run NodeJs

``` cd apis && npm run start ```

### Setup the RN Project

``` cd PVHTest && yarn ```

### Run the RN Project

``` react-native run-ios ```
